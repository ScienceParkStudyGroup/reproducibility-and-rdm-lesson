## Welcome!

In this training you will learn the basics of good Research Data Management. A lesson on Research Data Management the Carpentries way (2 days, lesson template, etc.)

We will use the Shell, Python and some specific Python packages  Make sure you have completed the Setup section. 


## Global aim
Raise awareness of what is RDM and how it can be implemented in one researcher's daily work.

## Target audience
- Early and late career Researchers: Interns, PhDs, Postdocs, Principal Investigators.
- Bachelor and Master students.

## Learning objectives

__1. File management__
  - File naming
  - Project file organisation
  - Data sharing
  - Archiving
  - Data Security
  
__2. Metadata__
  - Dublin Core
  - Domain-specific templates

__3. Ontologies__

__4. Archiving__:
  - Repositories: Zenodo, FigShare, etc.
  - Domain-specific repositories: NCBI SRA, MetaboLights, etc.
  
__5. The FAIR principles in action__

- _Findable_:
    * F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
    * F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)
    * F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe
    * F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource
- _Accessible_:
    * A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol
        - A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable
        - A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary
        - A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available
- _Interoperable_: 
    * I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
    * I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.
    * I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data
- _Reusable_: 
    * R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes
        - R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license
        - R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance
        - R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards

> ## Before you start
>
> Before the training, please make sure you have done the following: 
>
> 1. Consult what you need to do in the lesson [Setup](https://scienceparkstudygroup.github.io/rna-seq-lesson/setup.html).
> 2. Read the workshop [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) to make sure this workshop stays welcoming for everybody.
> 3. Get comfortable: if you're not in a physical workshop, be set up with two screens if possible. You will be following along in RStudio on your own computer while also following this tutorial on your own.
> More instructions are available on the workshop website in the **Setup** section.
