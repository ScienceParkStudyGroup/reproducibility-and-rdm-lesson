# What you will learn in this lesson

1. **How do you define the Research Data Life Cycle?** 
    - What are the main steps ?  
    - What can I do to preserve and reuse my research data?.
    - What are biological replicates and why are they important?
1. **What concepts and practices are comprised in Research Data Management?** 
    - What is the life cycle of a research dataset?  
    - What can I do to preserve and reuse my research data?.
    - What are biological replicates and why are they important?
1. **Why should you care about Research Data Management in general?**
    - Protect your valuable datasets for you, your team, other scientits and society in general.
    - Speed up your research findings by avoiding time loss when performing data-related tasks (saving, retrieving or analysing data).  
    - Funders are increasingly requiring good data management practices to grant proposals. 
    - Enhance your scientific reputation by showing that you embrace best practices on data management.

# The Research Data Life Cycle

Every piece of research 

## The Research Data Life Cycle in one scheme 

In this scheme, you can find the main steps of the Research Life Cycle.

In this lesson, our focus will be on:
- Creating data: 
  - Create a Data Management Plan: [/episodeEpisode This step will deal with capture of relevant metadata during the experiment, ways to record the data 


## The Research Data Life Cycle in a small movie (5min)
The University of Ghent has assembled a collection of knowledge clip. Here's the one on the Research Data Life Cycle:

Programme

Part 1: What is data management and how to set up your data collection system. At the end of part 1 you will:

    - be able to define research data and research data management;
    - understand how to systematically organise folders and (versions of) files;
    - know how to keep research notes to make a dataset understandable;
    - be aware of issues concerning privacy when working with people.

Part 2: Where to store your data and why share it? At the end of part 2 you will:

    - be familiar with the data storage solutions at WUR;
    - understand the (dis)advantages of different storage options;
    - understand the importance of making research data available to others;
    - be familiar with different open data licenses and their implications.

Part 3: How to make your data future-proof. At the end of part 3 you will:

    - know where and how to look for suitable repositories for your data;
    - know how to prepare a dataset for submission to a repository;
    - be familiar with the data management requirements, support and services at WUR;
    - have completed a draft data management plan for your project.
