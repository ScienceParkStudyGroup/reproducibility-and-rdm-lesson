# 1. What you will learn in this lesson

1. **How do you define the Research Data Life Cycle?** 
    - What are the main steps ?  
    - What can I do to preserve and reuse my research data?.
    - What are biological replicates and why are they important?
1. **What concepts and practices are comprised in Research Data Management?** 
    - What is the life cycle of a research dataset?  
    - What can I do to preserve and reuse my research data?.
    - What are biological replicates and why are they important?
1. **Why should you care about Research Data Management in general?**
    - Protect your valuable datasets for you, your team, other scientits and society in general.
    - Speed up your research findings by avoiding time loss when performing data-related tasks (saving, retrieving or analysing data).  
    - Funders are increasingly requiring good data management practices to grant proposals. 
    - Enhance your scientific reputation by showing that you embrace best practices on data management.  

# 2. What are research data? 

## 2.1 Warm-up 

> ## Discussion
> Pair up with someone in the workshop and try to define potential research data that you know.  
{: .discussion}


> ## Exercise
> From this list of items, can you choose which one are research data and why?
> 1. An article from a newspaper. 
> 2. An image taken from Wikipedia. 
> 3. Humidity level collected automatically by a hygrometer. 
> 4. Microscopy pictures taken by a scientist. 
>
> > ## Solution
> > Answers 3 and 4 would qualify as a research data. 
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}  

In short, everything you use during your research project could be qualified as "research data": this definition would encompass quite a variety of items:

__Laboratory notebooks__

# 3. The Research Data Life Cycle

Every piece of research 

## 3.1 The Research Data Life Cycle in one scheme 

In this scheme, you can find the main steps of the Research Life Cycle.

## 3.2 The Research Data Life Cycle in a small movie (5min)
The University of Ghent has assembled a collection of knowledge clip. Here's the one on the Research Data Life Cycle:

# 4. Research Data Management (RDM)

## 4.1 Rationale

The main rationales for engaging in better Research Data Management (RDM) are:

1. To protect data from being lost: physical damage to hard drives, a laptop being stolen,
2. To make it easier and quicker way to find data: imagine having to find a dataset from a year ago because a collaborator or a reviewer ask you to.
3. To enhance the security of your data: by relying on common well-established technical services (e.g. data repositories), the security of your data will be increased as you will be able to control who has access to it, specify the exact conditions to deliver access, etc.  
4. To improve your scientific reputation and career outcome: even unpublished, you can be cited for the data you've generated and be acknowledged. Also, embracing good practices in RDM 
5. To ease the sharing of data in both short- and long-term perspectives: you know where your data is located, what are the conditions to access it, how your data is formatted, etc.

# 5. Wageningen RDM course

Programme

Part 1: What is data management and how to set up your data collection system. At the end of part 1 you will:

    - be able to define research data and research data management;
    - understand how to systematically organise folders and (versions of) files;
    - know how to keep research notes to make a dataset understandable;
    - be aware of issues concerning privacy when working with people.

Part 2: Where to store your data and why share it? At the end of part 2 you will:

    - be familiar with the data storage solutions at WUR;
    - understand the (dis)advantages of different storage options;
    - understand the importance of making research data available to others;
    - be familiar with different open data licenses and their implications.

Part 3: How to make your data future-proof. At the end of part 3 you will:

    - know where and how to look for suitable repositories for your data;
    - know how to prepare a dataset for submission to a repository;
    - be familiar with the data management requirements, support and services at WUR;
    - have completed a draft data management plan for your project.
