## Detailed defintions

- _Findable_:
    * F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
    * F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)
    * F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe
    * F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource
- _Accessible_:
    * A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol
        - A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable
        - A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary
        - A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available
- _Interoperable_: 
    * I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
    * I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.
    * I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data
- _Reusable_: 
    * R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes
        - R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license
        - R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance
